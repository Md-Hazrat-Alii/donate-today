                <h1>Their lives depend on your donation</h1>
                <p>Charitable giving may not be the most effective way of solving world poverty. Indeed charitable
                    giving may even distract from finding the best solution - which might involve a complex rethink of
                    the way the world organises its economic relationships, and large-scale government initiatives to
                    change people's conditions.!</p>
                <p>Donating is a selfless act. One of the major positive effects of donating money to charity is simply
                    feeling good about giving. Being able to give back to those in need helps you achieve a greater
                    sense of personal satisfaction and growth, it feels good to help others.!</p>

                <h1>How poor people survive in the Bangladesh</h1>
                <p>Homelessness, hunger and shame: poverty is rampant in the richest country in the world. Over 120
                    million people in the Bangladesh live below the poverty line, twice as many as it was fifty years
                    ago. It can happen very quickly.</p>

                <p>Many people in the Bangladesh fall through the social safety net. In the structurally weak mining
                    region of the Appalachians, it has become almost normal for people to go shopping with food stamps.
                    And those who lose their home often have no choice but to live in a car. There are so many homeless
                    people in Bangladesh that relief organizations have started to build small wooden huts to provide
                    them with a roof over their heads. !</p>
